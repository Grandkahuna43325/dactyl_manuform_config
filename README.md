## This is my dactyl manuform keymaps.c

If you don't know what is qmk or keymaps.c you schould visit [qmk docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/)  

If you are starting(like me) this is perfect config for you. I tried to keep it simple and later on I will explain what everything does.


# This is first mode
It contains config for normal qwerty mode keyboard.

# This is second mode(mouse and numpad)
It contains keys for using mouse, changing volume and brightness and exec key.

# this is reset mode
It contains only the key to reset keyboard and a key to go back to first mode
